# Bachelor's Thesis

This repository contains the code for my bachelor's thesis about DL model compression.

It contains the code for individual experiments, but not for the compression methods, which are implemented in the `compress` library, hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/davidgonmar/compress).

Dependencies can be installed with

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The experiments for each section can be found in their respective folders.
